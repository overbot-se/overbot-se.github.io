    <font color="red">Please note that this guide is prone to change!</font>
    <br>
    <center><h3>Custom Prefix</h3></center>
    Setting a custom prefix is the easiest key to set. Since GuideBot uses a weird settings handler, the command is weird. To set a custom prefix, run the command <br> ~set edit prefix [new prefix here.] <br> If you want to view the existing prefix, ping the bot.
    <br>
    <br>
    <center><h3>Mod-Log Channel</h3></center>
    In order to change the Mod-Log Channel, run the following command, <br> [prefix]set edit modLogChannel [channel name] <br>
    Do not put # in front of the channel name because the bot handles names, not ids.
    <br>
    <br>
    <center><h3>Welcome Channel</h3></center>
    In order to change the Welcome Channel, run the following command, <br> [prefix]set edit welcomeChannel [channel name] <br> Again, do not put the # symbol in front of the channel name as OverBot does not handle channel ids.
    <br>
    <br>
    <center><h3>Welcome Message</h3></center>
    In order to change the welcome message, run the following command, <br> [prefix]set edit welcomeMessage [message]

      <b>Why aren't the moderation commands working?</b> <br>
        If the moderation commands don't work, you probably didn't set a modLogChannel, please refer to the Mod-Log Channel section above to find out how to set the modLogChannel key. <br>
      <b>Why isn't it showing a Welcome message?</b> <br>
        Regardless if you set a welcome message or not, you still need to have set the welcome channel, please refer to the Welcome Channel section above to find out how to set the welcomeChannel key.
